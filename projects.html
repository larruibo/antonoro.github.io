                                <p>Using a Cypress PSoC 5LP Microcontroller, our team prototyped an automatic flow-control valve for perfusion pumps. 
                                   Using a biological signal as input, such as heart rate or body temperature, the valve is able to regulate medication
                                   flow injected in the patient. The scope of our design was to offer a solution to urgent medication needs, that are at times
                                   difficult to provide since medical staff are spending less and less time with each patient.
                                </p>
                                <p>The PSoC 5LP Microcontroller runs on a ARM Cortex-M3 core microchip, built on a 32-bit architecture, 
                                   capable of state-of-the-art embedded digital signal processing. Our prototype wasn't tested on actual perfusion
                                   pumps, but the proof of concept showed a functional automatic flow-control process and a stable state-machine loop.

                                <p>My Third-Year project was individual and open. During my 2018 internship in Haiti, I collected ideas
                                   of medical devices that were most needed, or that were difficult to repair in low-resource countries.
                                   My goal was to create a low-cost, low-maintenance effective device that could be used about anywhere,
                                   with very few material resources. Autoclaves are a major part of an hospital capacity to provide patient-care.
                                   They are often in bad shape, need specific replacement parts or simply misused. This leads to incomplete
                                   sterilizing processes and infected surgical instruments, which are then used in surgery and expose patients
                                   to major risks.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                   I've decided to build a solar-powered autoclave, using a Fresnel focal Lens to heat water and produce steam,
                                   that would then be carried upwards to sterilize medical instruments. A PSoC 5LP Microcontroller was again
                                   used to monitor temperature inside the chamber and calculate the sterilization cycle, to ensure the process
                                   was done thorougly. The prototype was a success, being able to maintain the required 125 Celsius temperature
                                   during 30 minutes without interruption. At the Electrical Engineering projects competition, this solar-autoclave
                                   won the 3rd prize of the jury.

                                <p>All year-long, our team of 4 developed a prototype MRI antenna, in collaboration with the Montreal
                                   Institute of Cardiology, for micro-lesion brain imaging. Using resonant microelectronics circuits, 
                                   our antenna was tuned at 299.464 MHz and was designed to improve image resolution by a factor 3. The 
                                   medical scope of the project was to improve micro-lesion detections and facilitate scientific 
                                   research linking early loss of cognition to micro-lesions in the brain. This antenna is designed to 
                                   fit and be implanted on a live mouse skull during MRI imaging sessions.

                                <p>Using condensers and coils to create very-high frequency magnetic resonance (7T MRI at 299.464 MHz), this antenna is completely
                                   non-magnetic and matched at an impedance of 50 Ohms to optimize image resolution and minimize artefacts.
                                   It was tested multiple times in in-vivo imaging sessions on one mice subject, and showed great promise,
                                   boasting a signal-to-noise ratio superior to commercial antennas.

                                <p>My first internship took place in two haitian hospitals of Cap-Haitien, in the north of Haiti.
                                   With a team of four engineering students, we developed a medical equipment management software in Python,
                                   installed it in the two hospitals and provided a 2-month training to local biomedical technicians on 
                                   management and repairs, using our homemade software. From preventive maintenance to replacement part
                                   orders, our training aimed at durability and high-impact improvements. 
                                </p>
                                <p>I learned a lot in this internship, understanding the key factors and challenges that shape humanitarian
                                   and international aid, as well as the political situation in Haiti. I also understood that generic, low-cost
                                   and effective medical equipments were lacking. Medical technology companies are developing and selling high-performance, 
                                   high-cost instruments that are unfit to serve low-resource countries. I would like to design such equipments, 
                                   not regulated by high-cost FDA rules, that would be easy to repair, effective and aimed to help countries that 
                                   do not need multi-million medical machines, but simple and reliable instruments. It's my goal for the next 30 years!
