# antonoro.github.io

## 1: Objectives
This project is part of the Web Developent class at Universidad de los Andes, Bogota (Colombia). The objective was to create a webpage containing useful information for potential employers; my github repo would lead them to this website.

### Technologies used
A first html/CSS website was written to list and provide all information and contents needed in the website (basic styling). Then, Bootstrap was added and used to create a navigation bar header and a few other interactive features. 

## 2: Prerequisites
This website is basically self-supplied. All contents, from Bootstrap to Javascript, are included as links in the project. You'll only need a text editor (preferably with coding features) and a web browser to use it and modify it.
